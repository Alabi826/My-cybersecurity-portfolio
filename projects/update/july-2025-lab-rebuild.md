> ## 🛠️ Project Status Update – July 2025
>
> ### 📌 Summary
> This note documents the temporary pause, skipped phases, and recent developments in my ongoing cybersecurity project. It brings the lab status up to speed for transparency and future reference.
>
> ---
>
> ### ⏸️ Project Pause & Skipped Phases
> Due to challenges faced with OpenVAS on Ubuntu 24.04 and system resource constraints, I had to pause progress after **Phase 5A** (Log Inspection). Although **Phase 6 (Vulnerability Scanning)** was next, it couldn't proceed as intended due to compatibility issues.
>
> While waiting to upgrade my system, some sub-phases and deep dives were **skipped or postponed**:
> - Advanced automation for log correlation.
> - Full OpenVAS/Nessus vulnerability scans.
> - Integration with SIEM or alert systems.
>
> ---
>
> ### 💻 System Upgrade
> In July 2025, I transitioned to a **more powerful HP ZBook laptop**, enabling:
> - Smooth running of **multiple VMs** simultaneously.
> - Reliable performance for tools like **Greenbone Vulnerability Manager (OpenVAS)**.
>
> ---
>
> ### 🔄 Fresh Setup on New System
> A new virtual lab environment was established from scratch:
>
> - 🐧 **Kali Linux** – added unexpectedly, but perfect for GVM and advanced tools.
> - 🐧 **Ubuntu (latest stable version)** – replacing the earlier 22.04 version.
> - 🪟 **Windows 10** – retained for Windows-based endpoint testing.
> - 🔐 **pfSense** – still serving as the firewall/router for all internal networks.
>
> This rebuild marks a fresh baseline for continuing the project cleanly from **Phase 6** onward.
>
> ---
>
> ### ✅ Next Steps
> - Resume **Phase 6** – Vulnerability Scanning using Greenbone (GVM).
> - Fully document scans and security findings.
> - Revisit previously skipped or postponed sub-phases.
> - Continue building and refining the lab as a practical, evolving portfolio.
